    4. Add "nosepass" to the results, and continue. Once a word has
       been used, it can't be used again --- so we'll never get to
       use "bagon" or "nosepass" a second time.

    a dictionary (with the super-fast lookup they provide) can help;
    good solutions here will definitely require a dictionary.
